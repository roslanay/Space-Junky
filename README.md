# Space-Junky
Space Junky is a video game made as a comment on the current condition of outer space caused by the disposal of trash. The protagonist is an astronaut fighting for survival, after the cuts made in the budget of the International space station. The goal of the game is to collect as much wasted food as possible, and return to the space ship, before the timer runs out.
